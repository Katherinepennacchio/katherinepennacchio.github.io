The “I kissed the girl” singer is touring the world at the moment. So, I decided to make an interactive map using Odyssey.js to tell the story of the places she is going to visit in the next months.

I think this first experiment using Odyssey.js went pretty well, even though it was my first time playing with the new CartoDB tool. A couple of week ago, CartoDB released Odyssey.js: an open source library that enables creators to build interactive stories, no coding skills required; and makes map-based interactive storytelling easier to develop. Perfect for journalists like me that don’t know much about coding. 


#How to use Odyssey.js

The first thing I did was opening the [Odyssey.js] web site, of course. I clicked “create story” and then I choose Torque as my template. After that, Odyssey.js features a sandbox in which anyone can easily outline interactive stories using the human readable markup language Markdown to mix narrative, interaction, and multimedia.
I don't complicate myself much. I just made a Torque (animated map) first in my CartoDB account, I added it to my Odyssey.js sandbox and I started playing with the Markdown. If you want to try to make your own map with the data I used, you can get it from [here](https://kathy.cartodb.com/tables/katy_perry_s_prismatic_world_tour/public). 


Here are other cool Odyssey.js examples I have found on the web:
