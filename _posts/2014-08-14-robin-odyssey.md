I've been talking a lot lately about Odyssey.js. But for those who don't know, Odyssey.js is an open-source tool that allows you to combine maps, narratives, and other multimedia into a big story. It's great if you don't know much about coding like happens to me. 

The only thing that you have to know, is how to write in markdown. You will need it to write your story in the sandbox. Don't be scare. It's really easy. If you read this [tutorial](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) first, you will be ready to go! 

This time I wanted to create a visualization that changes as the reader moves through the narrative. So, I chose the scrool option.
