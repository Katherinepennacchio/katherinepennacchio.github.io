Tesla designs and manufactures premium electric vehicles. Model X, Model S and Model 3 are some of the cars that have been produced for this company. Tesla is the first true success story of the era of electric vehicules, and also the most successful new American car company in the last years.

But how did everything start? Where was the first Tesla showroom? How did they begin to grow so rapidly? I created the interactive story bellow to answer all these questions.

To create the map, I used the open source library that allows you to weave interactive stories on the web: Odyssey.js

Building the story was not difficult. I chose the option to display visualization chapters like slides in a presentation and I added a simple point map on my sandbox that I previously made on CartoDB. To add a CartoDB map on your Odyssey.js, you just need to paste (bellow the author name) the CartoDB.js link on sanbox that you get when you share a visualization. 



<div class="wrap"><p class="wrap-border"><img src="/images/odysseytesla.png" alt=""></p></div>



Then you just have to start writing your story using markdown.

#A Tip
I usually write my story first in a text editor for code and then I paste it into the sandbox. I am using Sublime Text at the moment which is free and easy to use. 

Remember to "move the map to current position" to add the exact location that you want to see while every slide is being displayed
