title: 'Playing with Odyssey.js one more time'
---

Between the 31st of July and the 1st of August 2014, a total of 163 new cases of Ebola virus disease were confirmed.  Also 61 deaths were reported in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone; according to the World Health Organization (WHO). That is why I decided to use [WHO data base](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/evd-outbreak.jpg) to make my own map-based story.

I chose Odyssey.js once again because it is a simple tool to create interactive stories on the web. But this time I HAVE added videos in the infowindows of my map points. 

Take a look at how I created my [Table](https://kathy.cartodb.com/tables/ebola_data/public) in CartoDB first. And this is the markdown I used for the editor:
