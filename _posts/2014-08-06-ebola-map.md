title: Playing with Odyssey.js one more time
---

Between the 31st of July and the 1st of August 2014, a total of 163 new cases of Ebola virus disease were confirmed.  Also 61 deaths were reported in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone; according to the World Health Organization (WHO). That is why I decided to use [WHO data base](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/evd-outbreak.jpg) to make my own map-based story. 

<!-- more -->

I chose Odyssey.js once again because it is a simple tool to create interactive stories on the web. But this time I HAVE added videos in the infowindows of my map points.

#How to add videos

It's not possible, for the moment, to add videos right on the Odyssey.js sandbox. In a few weeks, Odyssey.js will be merge into [CartoDB.com](http://cartodb.com/) and all we be much easier. 

To add the videos I went to my CartoDB account and created a table from the scratch. I did that way because I was searching for the information while I was doing the map. I used the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/) data, I searched for the latitude and longitude for each country in google maps and I found the videos iframes on youtube.

In the end, the [Table](https://kathy.cartodb.com/tables/ebola_data/public) looked like this. Keep in mind that you can edit the width and height of your video:

<div class="wrap"><p class="wrap-border"><img src="/images/scratch.png" alt=""></p></div>

Once I had my table ready, I started to created my visualization. I used two layer on my map, once for the points and other one to highlight only the countries I wanted: Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.

Go to this [tutorial](http://docs.cartodb.com/tutorials/multilayer_overview.html) to learn how to add layers on your CartoDB map. 


#Adding a CartoDB map to Odyssey.js 

When I was happy with how my map looked like, I pressed the share button and got my CartoDB.js link: 

<div class="wrap"><p class="wrap-border"><img src="/images/share.png" alt=""></p></div>

Finally I added that link on my sandbox in Odyssey.js and I started to write my story:

<div class="wrap"><p class="wrap-border"><img src="/images/sandbox.png" alt=""></p></div>


Also this is the markdown I used for the editor, if you want to take a look at it.
