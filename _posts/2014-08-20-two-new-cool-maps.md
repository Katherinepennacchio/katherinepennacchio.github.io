title: "Two new cool maps #ddjeverydamnday"

The philosophy of this blog is sharing visualizations, data or information about data journalism every damn day. Sometimes is not easy but I will do my best from now on. I will be sharing every post in twitter with the hashtag #ddjeverydamnday. 

<!-- more -->

I will be pleased to see your ideas and to share knowledge with all of you. I'm still learning, so you guys probably will be teaching me. 

So far this week I have done two maps. One using [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/) and the other one using [Odyssey.js](http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/). If you have been following my blog, you know how much I like Odyssey.js. I will be exploring other platforms lately, but at the moment I want to become an expert on this two. 

I did a compilation of significant protests around the world so far this year and the use of tear gas in them.  I published all that information on this map. I added images on the infowindows and I added text items on the visualization.

I also did this interactive story using Odyssey.js. Yesterday, August 19th, It was the release of Paulo Coelho's new book, "Adultery”. In anticipation of its release, I decided to make a list of the best books of the author and the places where the stories take place.
