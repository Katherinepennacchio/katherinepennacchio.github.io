title: "Visualizing Uber Vs. Lyft war"
---


The internet and smarthphones have opened up opportunities for disruptive services that provide on-demand individual transportation. [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) and [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) are the most important services of this type at the moment. 

Wheter you are a driver or a rider, Uber and Lyft allow you -using mobile phones-  to connect to a web service to arrange rides. 

The service usually costs less than a taxi, the payment is charged automatically to your credit card, you receive the receipt by email and tipping is forbidden. On the other hand, Uber and Lyft can offer better incomes to their drives than a regular cab driver gets. It all seems like a win-win situation, but it's not all rainbows and roses when it comes to peer-to-peer transportation companies. 

Professional cab drivers who pay huge amounts of money for a license are clearly not thrilled about these apps. Drivers in London, Paris, Berlin and Madrid, among others, have complained and protested against the services claiming they are not competing on the same playing field. 

The new subject that has been reaching headlines is the dispute between Uber and Lyft. Lyft and other competitors are claiming that Uber has created a sabotage plan to undermine them. Earlier this month, Lyft reported that Uber employees, around the country, ordered and then canceled 5,560 Lyft rides.  And that they are also having conversations with Lyft drives to try to get them to drive for Uber instead.

I decided to create this map where you can compare the reach and fees of each service in the United States. Use the "visible layer" to go from a service to the other. And press each button to take a look of the information window.
