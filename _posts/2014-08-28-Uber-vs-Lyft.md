title: "Visualizing Uber Vs. Lyft war"
---


The internet and smartphones have opened up numerous opportunities for disruptive services that provide on-demand individual transportation. [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) and [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) are the most important services of this type at the moment. 

Wheter you are a driver or a rider, Uber and Lyft allow you -using mobile phones-  to connect to a web service to arrange rides. 

The service usually costs less than a taxi and the payment is taken automatically from your credit card. You receive the receipt by email and giving tips is forbidden. On the other hand, Uber and Lyft can offer a better wage package to their drivers than regular cab drivers. 

It all seems like a win-win situation, but it's not all rainbows and roses when it comes to peer-to-peer transportation companies. 

Professional cab drivers who pay huge amounts of money for a license are clearly not thrilled about these apps. Drivers in London, Paris, Berlin and Madrid, among others, have complained and protested against the services claiming they are not competing on the same playing field.

Lately, the subject that has been attracting headlines is the dispute between Uber and Lyft. Lyft and other competitors are claiming that Uber has deduced a sabotage plan to undermine them. Earlier this month, Lyft reported that Uber employees, around the country, booked and then cancelled 5,560 Lyft rides. And that they are also contacting Lyft drivers to try to get them to drive for Uber instead.

#Uber Vs. Lyft 


I decided to create this map to compare the reach and fees of both services in the United States. Use the "visible layer" to go from one service to the other. And press each button to take a look at the information window.
